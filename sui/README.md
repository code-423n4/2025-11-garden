# SUI Atomic Swap Contract

A trustless atomic swap implementation on the SUI blockchain, written in Move.

## Overview

This contract implements Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) for atomic swaps on SUI, enabling secure cross-chain cryptocurrency exchanges without intermediaries. The contract ensures that either both parties receive their tokens or both parties get refunded - there's no middle ground.

To understand atomic swaps fundamentals, please refer to the [Garden Finance documentation](https://docs.garden.finance/home/fundamentals/introduction/atomic-swaps).

For the original Solidity implementation that inspired this contract, see: [HTLC EVM](https://docs.garden.finance/developers/contracts/htlc-evm)

## Key Features

- **Trustless Swaps**: No intermediaries required
- **Time-locked Security**: Automatic refunds after expiration
- **Signature Support**: Instant refunds with redeemer signature
- **Generic Coin Support**: Works with any SUI coin type
- **Event Emission**: Full transparency through event logs

## Architecture

### Core Data Structures

#### `Order<CoinType>`

Represents an individual atomic swap with the following properties:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the order
- `is_fulfilled`: Status flag to prevent double-spending
- `initiator`: Address that created the swap
- `redeemer`: Address of the intended recipient
- `amount`: Number of coins being swapped
- `initiated_at`: Timestamp of swap creation
- `coins`: The actual coins being held in escrow
- `timelock`: Duration before refund is allowed

#### `OrdersRegistry<CoinType>`

Central registry that stores all active orders for a specific coin type.

### Event System

The contract emits three types of events for complete transparency:

- **`Initiated`**: When a new swap is created
- **`Redeemed`**: When a swap is successfully completed
- **`Refunded`**: When a swap is refunded to the initiator

## Core Functions

### Creating Orders Registry

```rust
public fun create_orders_registry<CoinType>(ctx: &mut TxContext): ID
```

Creates a new shared registry for managing atomic swaps of a specific coin type.

### Initiating Swaps

```rust
public fun initiate<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    initiator: address,
    redeemer: address,
    secret_hash: vector<u8>,
    amount: u256,
    timelock: u256,
    coins: Coin<CoinType>,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

Creates a new atomic swap order. The initiator deposits coins that can be redeemed by providing the secret or refunded after the timelock expires.

**Parameters:**

- `orders_reg`: Registry to store the order
- `initiator`: Address of the swap initiator
- `redeemer`: Address of the intended recipient
- `secret_hash`: SHA-256 hash of the secret
- `amount`: Amount of coins to swap (must match coin value)
- `timelock`: Time period (in milliseconds) before refund is allowed
- `coins`: The coins to be held in escrow
- `clock`: SUI clock object for timestamp
- `ctx`: Transaction context

### Initiating on Behalf

```rust
public fun initiate_on_behalf<CoinType>(...)
```

Allows a third party to create an atomic swap on behalf of another address. Useful for automated systems or relayers.

### Redeeming Swaps

```rust
public fun redeem<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    secret: vector<u8>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

Completes an atomic swap by providing the correct secret. The coins are transferred to the redeemer's address.

**Validation:**

- Order must exist and not be fulfilled
- Secret must hash to the stored secret_hash
- Order ID must match the computed ID

### Refunding Swaps

```rust
public fun refund<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

Returns coins to the initiator after the timelock has expired.

**Requirements:**

- Order must exist and not be fulfilled
- Current time must exceed `initiated_at + timelock`

### Instant Refunds

```rust
public fun instant_refund<CoinType>(
    orders_reg: &mut OrdersRegistry<CoinType>,
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

Allows immediate refund by the redeemer, bypassing the timelock. This enables cooperative cancellations.

**Requirements:**

- Only the redeemer can call this function
- Order must exist and not be fulfilled
- No signature required - uses transaction sender validation

## Order ID Generation

Order IDs are deterministically generated using:

```
SHA-256(chain_id + secret_hash + initiator + redeemer + timelock + registry_id)
```

This ensures uniqueness and prevents replay attacks across different parameters.

## Security Features

### Parameter Validation

- Initiator and redeemer must be different addresses
- Amount must be greater than zero
- Timelock must be greater than zero
- Initiator cannot be the zero address
- Coin value must exactly match the specified amount

### Double-Spending Prevention

- Orders are marked as fulfilled after redemption or refund
- Duplicate order IDs are rejected
- State checks prevent multiple operations on the same order

### Cryptographic Security

- Uses SHA-256 for secret hashing
- Ed25519 signatures for instant refunds
- Keccak256 for type hashing and encoding

## Usage Example

```rust
// 1. Create registry
let registry_id = create_orders_registry<SUI>(ctx);

// 2. Initiate swap
initiate<SUI>(
    registry,
    initiator_address,
    redeemer_address,
    sha256_hash_of_secret,
    1000000000, // 1 SUI in MIST
    3600000,    // 1 hour timelock
    coins,
    clock,
    ctx
);

// 3. Redeem with secret
redeem<SUI>(registry, order_id, secret, ctx);

// OR refund after expiry
refund<SUI>(registry, order_id, clock, ctx);

// OR instant refund by redeemer
instant_refund<SUI>(registry, order_id, ctx);
```

## Chain Configuration

The contract includes chain ID configuration for proper order ID generation:

- **Mainnet**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- **Testnet**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`

⚠️ **Important**: Update the `sui_chain_id` in `create_order_id()` function before deploying to testnet.

## Supported Cryptography

Currently supports:

- **SHA-256** for secret hashing
- **Keccak256** for type hashing
- **Address-based validation** for redeemer authorization

## Testing

The contract includes comprehensive test coverage (100%) with test-only functions:

- `get_order()`: Retrieve order details
- `generate_order_id()`: Test order ID generation
- `get_refund_typehash()`: Get refund type hash
- `get_order_reg_id()`: Get registry ID

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
```

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Registry Management**: Each coin type requires its own registry
2. **Shared Objects**: Registries are shared objects accessible to all users
3. **Gas Optimization**: Functions are optimized for minimal gas usage
4. **Event Indexing**: Events enable easy tracking of swap lifecycle

## Deployment

The contract includes automated deployment scripts:

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
npm run deploy:testnet

# Create registry (required for functionality)
export SUI_PACKAGE_ID="0x..."
npm run create-registry:testnet
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.
